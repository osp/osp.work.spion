11	7	organisation_mission	<p style="text-align: left;">Q-O2 is a structurally subsidized workspace for experimental contemporary music and sound art since 2006 and has its own space in the Brussels canal zone. The workspace developed out of the contemporary music ensemble Q-O2.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">In practice, Q-O2 operates at three levels: it offers working residencies to artists; carries out projects in collaboration with national and international arts organizations; and holds performances and concerts in its own space.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">In musical terms Q-O2 explores mainly three lines of approach: acoustic and electronic improvisation and composed music as well as installations and sound art. Through its conceptual preoccupations Q-O2 finds easily points of access to other disciplines.</p>

212	55	artist_name	Justin Bennett
213	55	artist_bio	The widely ranging work of Justin Bennett is as rooted in the audiovisual and visual arts as it is in music. Central to his thinking and his work is a process-orientated approach and an interest in the elasticity of the concept of ’space’. Bennett produces (reworked) field recordings, drawings, performances, installations, photographs, videos and essays. He brings the characteristic potentials and capacities of each medium into every new work, paying no heed to the divisions between these media. Recently his work has focussed on urban development, technological progress and the relationship between architecture and sound. He gives lectures, hosts workshops, produces soundtracks for experimental filmmakers and is a member of the performance group, BMB con.\nBennett studied Fine Art at Sheffield City Polytechnic, UK, followed courses in Sonology at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague and studied video with Elsa Stansfield at the Jan Van Eyck Academy in Maastricht.   \n\nRecent projects and exhibitions include: \n\n“The Oracle of Zürich” work in public space (2011)\n“Ticket to Amsterdam” (with Renate Zentschnig) Audio tour in Istanbul.

161	40	artist_name	Claudio Curciotti
162	40	artist_bio	about me Claudio Curciotti had composed experimental electronic music since 2000, publishing some works for international netlabels and participating in festivals in Europe and North Africa under the pseudonym of IQBIT. In his production he explores different type of sounds, from Electroacustic to IDM and Field Recording. His experience as a musician is reflected in the work of recording and selection of environmental sounds, in which emerges a sensibility towards the acoustic textures and intensities. With the latest projects he tries his hand at video editing, concentrating on the rhythmic relationship between sound and still images. He’s also into experimenting with compositional sound work in which electronic frequencies are mixed to field recordings. He’s the creator of Field Abuse, a blog archive focused on the human noise and the loudness of the contemporary world related to religion, ethnic music and traditional cultures. He’s associated artist of PVA Medialab, of Bridport, UK, currently collaborating with them with a multi speaker sound installation about the sounds preceding a revolution, a project realized in Egypt, recording sounds just before the beginning of the 25th January uprising.

177	44	artist_bio	‘I am fascinated and passionate about the infinite detail and expanding vistas of life around us, its sights and sounds, often overlooked or hidden. My creative output focuses on this never ending, joyous exploration via intuitive composition, conventional & extended field recording techniques, photography & photographic scores. The music / sound I create has evolved from improvisation to what I prefer to term 'intuitive composition' and has increasingly involved elements such as a love of audible silence & stillness & the empathy of compositional lines. These evolved from my need to always remain open to my emotive, intuitive response to situations & environments’ - JrF \n\n\nUsing intuitive composition, field recording, improvisation and photography, Jez riley French has been exploring his enjoyment of detail, simplicity and his emotive response to places and situations for the past 3 decades.\n\nAlongside solo performances and exhibitions he collaborates with other artists, runs the ‘in place’ & 'a quiet position' projects on field recording – a subject on which he also lectures & tutors in workshops, organizes the ‘seeds & bridges’ event series, runs the ‘engraved glass’ label & published a free monthly pdf arts magazine 'tristesse engraved'.\n\nIn recent years Jez has been working extensively on recordings of surfaces and architectural spaces, some results of which make up the ‘....audible silence’ edition and has also been developing the concept of photographic scores.\n

199	51	artist_use	My practice is people orientated and explores issues in an engaging and creative way. I feel that each different subject area under investigation demands different approaches to achieve defined representation. My vision is explored through print, photography, moving image and sound. One of my main motivations is to help make sense of the things around us and to help serve as my visual memory. Whether it is exploring personal memories or looking at how we relate to our surroundings or simply looking more closely at the objects and spaces around us. I have added field recordings into my repertoire of community engaged work I undertake. As these types of recordings can be made with relatively cheap equipment. And the places, where noises are recorded, are not excluding socially disadvantaged groups. Far from it: Any worker, anybody on a bus or walking down the street can document noises in a much better way than managers, who lead a life in between the office and the company car. Through field recordings, the listeners can experience the sound of places that they might never be able to visit. That is not only a quality of a field recording but also of photography – both record media can easily comple­ment one another. Their authenticity is not as important as their prospect of recording moments, atmospheres, noises and images and making them accessible, so that people can visualise a place they did not know. The new experiences and discoveries inspire people and make them “see” their world in a different way.

271	70	organisation_mission	Communication Space Školská 28 is a multifunctional space for various nonprofit cultural and artistic activities. It is located in the courtyard of the neo-renaissance residential building “U rytířů”, which was built in 1888. The space occupied by Školská 28 consists of an attached building that was constructed later, in 1939, which served as a workshop for galvanizing metal. During 1998-99, this parcel was renovated to its current form by the Linhart Foundation, and was opened to the public in January, 1999. The programming conception of the space arises from the specific characteristics of the location, where it is situated. The space offers the community a variety of public activities connected to social life in the center of Prague. These activities take the form of a wide spectrum of initiatives, projects, and activities, and they also contribute to a revitalization of facilities for the improvement of the local civic conditions of inter generational communication, while working together with other non-commercial initiatives. The exhibition program is dedicated to the presentation of contemporary culture, presenting one of the small spaces on the cultural map of Prague, where one can meet and freely confront young artists from the Czech Republic and abroad, without consideration of the commercial aspect of contemporary gallery workings. Communication Space Školská 28 was managing since 2005 the international project of artists residencies Open Studios Prague originally in Dolní Počernice, later in Prague, which offers living and working space to projects, that require long-term preparation and use of studio space. Until 2005, the space was managed by the Linhart Foundation, later the Linhart Society, o.p.s. In 2006, stewardship was transferred to the civic association DEAI/setkání, which continues the mission of the Linhart Foundation. The project is supported by a grant from the Prague Municipal. The exhibition and parallel programs is realized since 2005 with the kind financial support from the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic.

279	72	organisation_mission	Locus Sonus is a research group specialized in audio art. It is organized as a post graduate lab by the Art Schools of Aix en Provence (ESAA) and Bourges (ENSA) in France. We have a partnership with sociology lab CNRS, LAMES Aix en Provence (which is interested by the way practices relate to new technologies and are creating modifications in artistic production and the way that the audience reacts to these modifications). We currently continue collaborations with the CRESSON, architecture lab CNRS in Grenoble (sonic spaces research centre), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), and other international partners. Locus Sonus is concerned with the innovative and transdisciplinary nature of audio art forms, in the framework of networked sonic spaces, some of which are experimented and evaluated in a lab type context. An important factor is with the collective or multi-user aspects inherent to many emerging audio practices and which necessitate working as a group. The main goals define this research - audio in it's relation to space and networked audio systems. Today our research is grouped under several main headings <strong>Sound and Distance</strong>, <strong>Field Spatialization</strong>, <strong>Networked Sonic Spaces</strong>, <strong>Audio Fluxes</strong>, <strong>Sonification</strong>, and <strong>Internet Auditoriums</strong>. <strong>Locus Sonus Lab 2007/2011 :</strong> Julien Clauss, Stéphane Cousot, Alejandro Duque, Scott Fitzgerald, Jérôme Joy, Anne Laforet, Grégoire Lauvin, Anne Roquigny, Peter Sinclair.

313	78	organisation_mission	<strong>Tuned City is a platform which proposes an examination of the relations between architecture and sound. </strong> The project draws the traditions of critical discussion about urban space within the architecture and urban planning discourse–as well as its strategies and working methods–into the context of sound art. This expanded discussion reenforces the potential of the spatial and communicative properties of sound as a tool and means of urban practice. At the foundations of this event are artists’ works and theoretical approaches which examine in a critical and sensitive way the given urban and architectural situations alongside their resulting socio-political implications, that re-use existing spaces or that conceive and open new spaces. A dialogue will be built at the intersection of both disciplines which traces out the complex relations and interactions of space-sound, both presenting and testing new strategies, methods, possibilities and potentials of sound work within the artistic and applied context. The first exhibition and conference project <strong>Tuned City – Between sound and space speculation</strong> was taking place from July 01.-05. 2008 in Berlin, almost 100 artists, architects and thinkers gathered together in a variety of locations around the city and discussed a new evaluation of architectural spaces from the perspective of the acoustic. See <a href="http://www.tunedcity.net/?page_id=12">tuned city 2008</a>. Tuned City continues as a platform, exploring other cities and locations with their own cultural and social settings, working theoretically and practically on the question how sound and architecture are related.

315	81	artist_name	Els Viaene
316	81	artist_bio	Els Viaene (°1979, Belgium) started her work as a sound artist / field recordist in 2001. With a set-up of two small microphones she listens, zooms into and enlarges the aural landscapes surrounding us. The natural rhythms and textures of the sounds hidden in those landscapes form the basis of her work.\n\nWorking on these sound materials for performances, sound compositions or installations she makes the listeners travel in imaginary and organic environments.\n\nThrough the specific use and set-up of sound within a space her installations create new spaces within existing ones, either emphasizing or making dissapear the physical borders of that space. In doing so she often plays with the notions of seeing and hearing, the perception of what we see and hear and how both interfere.
317	81	artist_use	I use sounds surrounding us cause of their rich textures and organic shapes. Sometimes one sound within a location attracts me to create a new project sometimes it's the memory connected to the recording and location. The sounds hidden in the field inspire me in many different ways.

My interest in field recording/soundscape is both analytical (for academic purposes) and synthetic, for creative applications. A range of works, most employing manipulated found sounds, can be found at http://soundcloud.com/tony-langlois

517	150	artist_bio	Luc Messinezis was born in Athens, Greece in 1977. He studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Patras, Greece yet despite his scientific background, he developed a great interest in sound and experimental compositional strategies. \nAfter relocating in the UK, Luc achieved an MA in Sound Arts at the University of the Arts, London and has developed several projects researching the means throughout which sound can constitute the base for artistic expression. \nPhonography, electroaccoustic/concrete composition, audiovisual works and sound installations are just a few of the ways of experimenting with sound and its potential as a medium of creative practice.\n\nLuc’s conceptual interests mainly focus in triggering feelings, aural awareness and memory by challenging the perception and stimulating the imagination of the audience.
518	150	artist_use	Luc has been has been using phonography and field recording as the main source of raw materials with which he realizes his artworks. Either as autonomous works or sources for extracting sound objects or matter for composition or use within an installation, Messinezis has presented various pieces and pieces around the globe in countries such as Austria, Greece, UK, Canada and Israel.\n\nNoticeable works include:\n\n"Eavesdropping; Crisis" - Ethnographic Terminalia 2011, Montreal [CA]\n\n"Forest in a Forest" - L & B Gallery, Ein Hod artist's village [IL]\n\n"The sound cabinet of curiosities" - IMT Gallery, London [UK]

531	154	artist_use	For his records he is constantly searching new sounds, mainly on-site testimonies & field recordings but he is primarily interested in the idea of recording what is not supposed to be : \ngear failures, the death of a PA systems, electro-static background noises. voltage errors and in how failure can become something more than just annoying.\n \nIn 2011 He has started a field recording blog about unusual (field) recordings.\n\nhttp://franciscomeirino.blogspot.com/\n

559	163	organisation_name	Sonic Postcards
560	163	organisation_mission	What does your environment sound like? We’re used to looking at the world around us, but how much time do we spend listening? What happens when we concentrate on our soundscape as much as our landscape? And what can we learn about other communities and other locations through the medium of sound?\n\nSonic Postcards is a unique and innovative national education programme which explores these issues and encourages participants to “open their ears”. The project enables pupils from across the UK to explore and compare their local sound environments through the composition and exchange - via the internet - of sound postcards with other schools.\n\nThe project focuses on the impact of sound on our lives and demonstrates the possibilities for creativity through the manipulation of sounds with technology. As with an ordinary postcard it offers the opportunity for people to exchange information about their local environments; providing windows into a variety of places, lives and cultures in rural, urban and coastal locations.\n\nSonic Postcards is aimed at young people between the ages of 9-14 in primary, secondary and special schools, PRUs (Pupil Referral Units) and community groups across the country.\n\nThe project links a number of curriculum studies at Key Stages 2 and 3, including music, geography and ICT, as well as English, citizenship, art, history, biology and physics and is pertinent to key government initiatives for e-learning and for the environment. Sonic Postcards follows both good practice and government guidelines for working with young people.\n\nSonic Postcards is run by <a title="http://www.sonicartsnetwork.org/" href="http://www.sonicartsnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Sonic Arts Network</a>, the national organisation which explores the art of sound.

659	189	artist_bio	Born in New Zealand in 1939 and living in the US since 1973, Annea Lockwood is known for her explorations of the rich world of natural acoustic sounds and environments, in works ranging from sound art and installations, through text-sound and performance art to concert music. Her music has been performed in many venues and festivals including: the Possibility of Action exhibition at MACBA Barcelona, De Ijsbreker, the Other Minds Festival-San Francisco, the Walker Art Center, the American Century: 1950 - 2000 exhibition at the Whitney Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum, Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Westdeutscher Rundfunk, CNMAT Berkeley, the Asia-Pacific Festival, Donaufest 2006 Ulm, the Donau Festival Krems, the 7th Totally Huge New Music Festival Perth, Ear To The Earth Festival - New York and Sonic Acts XIII.\n\nHer sound installation, A Sound Map of the Danube, has been presented in Germany, Austria and the USA. This is a surround 'sound map' of the entire Danube River, incorporating a wide variety of water, animal and underwater insect sounds, rocks from the riverbed and the voices of those whose lives are intimately connected to the river. Other recent projects include Ceci n'est pas un piano, for piano, video and electronics commissioned by Jennifer Hymer; Jitterbug, commissioned by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a six channel soundscape with two improvising musicians; and In Our Name, a collaboration with Thomas Buckner based on poems by prisoners in Guantánamo. She was a recipient of the 2007 Henry Cowell Award. Her music has been issued on CD and online on the Lovely Music, Ambitus, EM, XI, Rattle, Lorelt, and Pogus labels.

623	181	artist_use	What mainly interests me are the stories that can be told through the soundscapes of everyday life. My 23 minute work 'Soundscape Nicosia' explores the changes on Nicosia's soundscape, reflecting the changes in people's habits, beliefs, culture and general way of living.\nI am also using field recordings as raw material for creating abstract sound works or environments in installations.\nMoreover I am a collector of existing sounds or sounds that are about to vanish, and collector of sounds from my travelling.

660	189	artist_use	Field recording is a solitary activity for me. It is intimate and meditative, my way of\nrecognising/reinforcing my deep connection to the world around me. Although I have incorporated field recordings in many pieces since the 1970s, (for example Tiger Balm, Delta Run, Duende), it is my sound maps of rivers which are most completely grounded in the practice: A Sound Map of the Hudson River (1982), A Sound Map of the Danube (2005), A Sound Map of the Housatonic River (2010). These sound maps are a process of exploration: exploration of a phenomenon - moving water, of the environments it shapes, of people’s connection to rivers, of my own connection to rivers. The experience of field recording as exploration seems common to many of us; I think of the superb work of Steven Feld, Hildegard Westerkamp, David Dunn, Sam Auinger, Yolande Harris. \n\nWhen working on a river I select sites ‘by ear’, searching out unfamiliar water textures, then quieting myself internally so that I can hear deeply into the details of that texture and feel the river’s energy at that particular location. Beyond rather minimal use of equalization and editing I don’t process these recordings; after selecting sites I weave them into a continuous flow, varying their durations, the pacing of the transitions between sites and of spatial movement amongst the speakers. I want to bring these sounds to listeners as directly as possible, so I try to reduce awareness of my composing presence in the work. The installation design is kept simple, the focus firmly on the aural -  there is a wall map, a time display allowing listeners to identify sites, sometimes river rocks.  My intention is not to document a particular river or my own experience of it, but to induce a sense of immersion in its energy flow, and a visceral recognition of its power.

693	193	artist_bio	Pauwel De Buck is a soundartist living and working in Ghent, Belgium. His soundworks have been presented in installations as well as in performances. He utilizes location recordings of the urban environment to combine them with analogue electronic sounds. The end result is as much time based as it is sculptural and spatial. The work traverse between concrete sound environments and abstract sonic spaces. Pauwel De Buck participated in residencies, performed his work in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and the USA. Made installations, soundtracks for various purposes. His sound works are released at the London Based Entr'acte label.
694	193	artist_use	My fascination for sounds and the use of field recording arose during my studies at the academy of fine arts. This situation was, and still is, very important for my approach to this medium. My ideas, working methods and presentations very closely relate to installation and performance art.   Sound as a plastic means in an artistic context is an intuitive choice for me. Active listening allows me to experience my environment in a more clear and better way. In this I see a reflection of how our society moves and changes. It is the artist’s luxury to observe these changes and reflect on them. The action of capturing, of making a recording, is in this respect not merely registration, but actually the starting point of a creative process.   The combination of technology and imagination makes it possible to structure and analyse the vast amount of sounds that surround us, and can then be processed into new surrealist situations. This process is a single yet constant flux of movement, an experience in which different recordings are played over one another, mixed, transformed and recaptured. Little by little new textures and connections are formed, that are placed in a bigger framework. This frame forms the basis for the final result, taking on different shapes.

703	195	artist_email	holterbache@yahoo.fr
704	195	artist_bio	The sound work of Emmanuel Holterbach aims to reveal the richness of acoustic patterns that emerge spontaneously from the vast ocean of sounds in which we live. Captured frequencies and field recordings, unorthodox ways of playing musical instruments, methods attempting to stop the clock by a careful use of sound and space: what Emmanuel Holterbach does with sound could be likened to the music, yet it is primarily a tool to induce people into a reverie or immerse them into an active contemplation. This leads to the revelation of the poetic forces naturally at work in our everyday soundscape. Emmanuel Holterbach invented some of the instruments, microphones and loudspeakers he uses. Since 1992, his in-situ sound installation work has been presented in Europe, Québec and China; he is now represented by the Roger Tator gallery in Lyon (France). He plays in a number of ensembles: Orbs, eHœCo, Tonton Macoute, or alone in La Chambre Bas-Parlante. Holterbach composes electroacoustic works using sound captures from natural and industrial environments, the rustling of creatures, vibrations of materials and buildings; in addition, he creates works for traditional and exotic acoustic instruments. Since 2004, Holterbach has been organizing the publication of Eliane Radigue's archives; he introduces her electronic music in concerts and is writing her biography. He also contributes to the magazines Mettray, Tausend Augen, and Revue &amp; Corrigée and he is the founder of the Productions Fluorescentes, a label for the production of sound objects.
705	195	artist_use	In my sound recording work, the anecdotal or documentary aspect is not really what interests me most. I'm not a documentary filmmaker; my work is mostly musical. What interests me is the intense spontaneous musicality of some natural phenomena, whether in animal noises or in the secret sounds made by machines. This musicality features outstanding vanishing lines in the History of Music, migrations of influences that I also like to capture. Incidentally, I should clarify that, basically, my sound recording work reveals as much of the outside environment as of my inner world. Essentially, my compositional work stems from the experience of intently listening to the environment.

711	197	artist_bio	Marinos Koutsomichalis (b. Athens, Greece 1981) sound-artist, composer.\n\nActive internationally in both academic and non academic milieus, MK is being composing and performing exploratory sound (and sometimes visual) art since the mid '00s using a variety of mediums - computers, programming languages, acoustic instruments / ensembles, analogue electronics, loudspeakers, domestic appliances, environmental sounds or photography amongst others. He is mainly interested in how sonic/visual phenomena manifest in the space-time-consciousness complex and how he can create aesthetically intriguing artworks based on such manifestations as mediums in themselves. He has no interested in expressing or representing anything - his art aims rather at fulfilling space and at essentially stimulating one' s state of being instead.

734	200	artist_bio	Composer, performer, curator, lives in situ. Manfred Werder focuses on possibilities of rendering the practices regarding composition and field. His recent scores have featured either found sentences from poetry and philosophy, or found words from whatever sources. His performances, both indoors and outdoors, aim at letting appear the world’s natural abundance. Earlier works include stück 1998, a 4000 page score whose nonrecurring and intermittent performative realization has been ongoing since December 1997.
735	200	artist_use	THE FIELD\nLe pré, aussi, est une façon d’être. Décidons de nous y laisser aller, aujourd’hui. The field, as well, is a way of being. Let’s decide to drift there, today. (Francis Ponge: La Fabrique du Pré (Paris, le 22 octobre 1 960), 1 971 ) (transl. MW) nature has unconditioned reality (Schelling, 1 799; cit.: Iain Hamilton Grant, Philosophies of Nature after Schelling, 2008, p 21 ) I propose the field not to be a ‘material’. ‘Material’ would be that what a phenomenological assumption once more identifies as isolated objects to be perceived. ‘Silence’ has been one method of breaking this phenomenological assumption: The experienced extensions of the places of performance have definitely provoked the field to be of central concern. We could identify ‘material’ with Kant as the world’s appearance for us. How can we think the extension of a place not exclusively projected/experienced by a limited group of privileged subjects (performers and audience)? The extension of a place where all is permanently drifting in its own right. The intrinsic reality of a situation. All is permanently drifting, thus we might say: There is no outside the performative. I don’t talk of predicates (variables, characteristics, properties) of a world (they describe the world’s appearances for me) but I do of the world’s mere operating. There is no outside the field. It also includes the digital silence in the editing of a ‘recording’ as a possible frame, as far as it unconditions this specific reality, as one conceptual form of the field. Personally I prefer not having the human subject privileged in its relation to the world A spider is integrating parts of my body in its cobweb. The field: Be it unconditioned reality.

746	202	artist_bio	Anne Wellmer is a composer, performer and media artist based in The Hague. Wellmer uses field recordings, live sound processing and electronically generated sound in her work, which shifts between tape music, improvisation, installation and performance. Feedback, electromagnetic disturbances and barely audible acoustic phenomena make out essential aspects of her work. In 2007 she received an honoray mention in digital musics from the Prix Ars Electronica in Linz.
747	202	artist_use	“I compose spaces and environments. The players of my pieces improvise freely in a defined framework. I work with computer processes, televisions, feedback, analog synthesizers, audio and video recordings, physical spaces, interferences, barely audible acoustic phenomena and field recordings. Apart from microphones I also  contact mics, coils and antenna’s to explore my environment and to make inaudible signals audible to the human ear. Those of my works which are based on field recordings are studies about places and objects. They are accompanied by little stories. Like entries to a diary and similar to photographs these pieces shape my memory.”

751	203	artist_name	martiensgohome
752	203	artist_bio	Martiensgohome is a sound collective who has been fooling around with recordings for more than 15 years. They present the resulting soundscapes every Thursday on Radio Campus Brussels (9:30 pm on 92.1 fm) . Each programme consists of a one-hour-long improvisation, using sounds recorded that week or taken from their extensive field-recording archive. The core of the collective consists today of four musicians, often augmented by guest musicians. martiensgohome is also performing live whenever possible, preferably in special settings, composing site-specific interventions or playing unconventional venues.
753	203	artist_use	Since its inception in 1996, the Brussels collective martiensgohome has collected, treated and played various forms of field recordings. Starting as a radio show, still broadcasting on Radio Campus Bruxelles (92.1fm) every week, the collective has focused from the start on non-musical sound sources. Noise, machine failure, contact-mike recordings, radio statics and larger scale field recordings, every available sound is examined, tried out, deformed or kept intact, and assembled to take part in an improvised counterfeit soundscape. No hierarchy is established between them, and small sounds, background hum, or glitches, are treated with the same respect as more explicit, more significant or more musical sounds. All those recordings are later abstracted, blurred, distorted, warped beyond recognition, taken sometimes as far as possible from their origins, and set in motion in a sonic fiction, a narrative of mystery and contingency. In this respect, the realistic, representational, quality of the recordings is secondary to their aural properties, to what they can see in them, to what they can make of them. Their radio programmes and concerts consist of different moments, various locations, multiple acoustic spaces and times woven together to produce a hybrid place, governed by a composite chronology. It remains nonetheless a place, an ephemeral and artificial site, but a bearings of sorts, complete with movement, activity, liveliness, sometimes even inhabitants. It is a fantasy, a truth lying somewhere between a lie and a fiction.

It is located in the courtyard of the neo-renaissance residential building “U rytířů”, which was built in 1888. The space occupied by Školská 28 consists of an attached building that was constructed later, in 1939, which served as a workshop for galvanizing metal. During 1998-99, this parcel was renovated to its current form by the Linhart Foundation, and was opened to the public in January, 1999. The programming conception of the space arises from the specific characteristics of the location, where it is situated. The space offers the community a variety of public activities connected to social life in the center of Prague. These activities take the form of a wide spectrum of initiatives, projects, and activities, and they also contribute to a revitalization of facilities for the improvement of the local civic conditions of inter generational communication, while working together with other non-commercial initiatives. The exhibition program is dedicated to the presentation of contemporary culture, presenting one of the small spaces on the cultural map of Prague, where one can meet and freely confront young artists from the Czech Republic and abroad, without consideration of the commercial aspect of contemporary gallery workings. Communication Space Školská 28 was managing since 2005 the international project of artists residencies Open Studios Prague originally in Dolní Počernice, later in Prague, which offers living and working space to projects, that require long-term preparation and use of studio space. Until 2005, the space was managed by the Linhart Foundation, later the Linhart Society, o.p.s. In 2006, stewardship was transferred to the civic association DEAI/setkání, which continues the mission of the Linhart Foundation. The project is supported by a grant from the Prague Municipal. The exhibition and parallel programs is realized since 2005 with the kind financial support from the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic.

916	72	organisation_mission	Locus Sonus is a research group specialized in audio art. It is organized as a post graduate lab by the Art Schools of Aix en Provence (ESAA) and Bourges (ENSA) in France. We have a partnership with sociology lab CNRS, LAMES Aix en Provence (which is interested by the way practices relate to new technologies and are creating modifications in artistic production and the way that the audience reacts to these modifications). We currently continue collaborations with the CRESSON, architecture lab CNRS in Grenoble (sonic spaces research centre), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), and other international partners. Locus Sonus is concerned with the innovative and transdisciplinary nature of audio art forms, in the framework of networked sonic spaces, some of which are experimented and evaluated in a lab type context. An important factor is with the collective or multi-user aspects inherent to many emerging audio practices and which necessitate working as a group. The main goals define this research - audio in it's relation to space and networked audio systems. Today our research is grouped under several main headings <strong>Sound and Distance</strong>, <strong>Field Spatialization</strong>, <strong>Networked Sonic Spaces</strong>, <strong>Audio Fluxes</strong>, <strong>Sonification</strong>, and <strong>Internet Auditoriums</strong>. <strong>Locus Sonus Lab 2007/2011 :</strong> Julien Clauss, Stéphane Cousot, Alejandro Duque, Scott Fitzgerald, Jérôme Joy, Anne Laforet, Grégoire Lauvin, Anne Roquigny, Peter Sinclair.

942	78	organisation_mission	<strong>Tuned City is a platform which proposes an examination of the relations between architecture and sound. </strong> The project draws the traditions of critical discussion about urban space within the architecture and urban planning discourse–as well as its strategies and working methods–into the context of sound art. This expanded discussion reenforces the potential of the spatial and communicative properties of sound as a tool and means of urban practice. At the foundations of this event are artists’ works and theoretical approaches which examine in a critical and sensitive way the given urban and architectural situations alongside their resulting socio-political implications, that re-use existing spaces or that conceive and open new spaces. A dialogue will be built at the intersection of both disciplines which traces out the complex relations and interactions of space-sound, both presenting and testing new strategies, methods, possibilities and potentials of sound work within the artistic and applied context. The first exhibition and conference project <strong>Tuned City – Between sound and space speculation</strong> was taking place from July 01.-05. 2008 in Berlin, almost 100 artists, architects and thinkers gathered together in a variety of locations around the city and discussed a new evaluation of architectural spaces from the perspective of the acoustic. See <a href="http://www.tunedcity.net/?page_id=12">tuned city 2008</a>. Tuned City continues as a platform, exploring other cities and locations with their own cultural and social settings, working theoretically and practically on the question how sound and architecture are related.

964	260	organisation_mission	What does your environment sound like? We’re used to looking at the world around us, but how much time do we spend listening? What happens when we concentrate on our soundscape as much as our landscape? And what can we learn about other communities and other locations through the medium of sound?\n<BR><BR>\nSonic Postcards is a unique and innovative national education programme, led by <a href="http://soundandmusic.org/">Sound and Music</a>, which explores these issues and encourages participants to “open their ears”. The project enables pupils from across the UK to explore and compare their local sound environments through the composition and exchange - via the internet - of sound postcards with other schools. \n<BR><BR>\nThe project focuses on the impact of sound on our lives and demonstrates the possibilities for creativity through the manipulation of sounds with technology. As with an ordinary postcard it offers the opportunity for people to exchange information about their local environments; providing windows into a variety of places, lives and cultures in rural, urban and coastal locations. Sonic Postcards is aimed at young people between the ages of 9-14 in primary, secondary and special schools, PRUs (Pupil Referral Units) and community groups across the country. The project links a number of curriculum studies at Key Stages 2 and 3, including music, geography and ICT, as well as English, citizenship, art, history, biology and physics and is pertinent to key government initiatives for e-learning and for the environment.\n<BR><BR>\nSonic Postcards is run by Sound and Music, the UK’s landmark organisation for the promotion of contemporary music and sound art. SAM brings together artists, producers, promoters and educators to deliver work that encourages people of all ages to engage with music and sound in all its forms, through its live events, learning programme and digital platforms.

A system of exchange and cooperation has been maintained, esp. with Central Europe. Over the years, we started to work more on longer-term projects, involving very diverse artists and experts, of all levels of experience, but with a common interest in the experimental and environmental. For that reason we started up a larger project "Time Inventors' Kabinet", concentrating on the notion of Time in our present culture.\n<BR><BR>\nYou can listen here to a soundfile of bees playing with a piezo in the OpenGreen garden: [audio bees_piezo]

1030	427	organisation_mission	Recyclart est un centre artistique ayant les particularités suivantes.\nRecyclart a été dès le départ fortement lié au lieu dans lequel l’association est située et fortement ancrée dans un quartier et une ville qui l’entoure. Transformer la rupture urbaine provoquée par la Jonction Nord-Midi en une liaison vivante, assurer un lien fort entre les différents quartiers qui l’entoure est un but que l’association a poursuivi depuis sa naissance. L’association reste aujourd’hui un projet urbain. Elle s’inspire de la ville qui l’entoure et laisse sa porte grande ouverte aux phénomènes urbains (qu’ils soient d’ordre culutrel, sociaux ou économiques).\n\nRecyclart intègre tous les volets du processus artistique en son sein : la création (via notamment la mise à disposition d’espace à des jeunes artistes)  la diffusion  (via une programmation de qualité) et la production (via la réalisation concrète de pièces de design, de décors de théâtre ou d’installations plastiques…).\n\nRecyclart ne pose aucune hiérarchie entre les disciplines et défend un art à la fois ouvert sur l’érudit et le populaire. Recyclart défini l’art comme un outil « politique » qui fait réfléchir sur notre société et aide à la construction d’une véritable cohésion sociale en ville et à la construction d’un pont entre les cultures, les classes sociales et les univers différents. L’accent est donc mis sur le petit, le fragile, et le vulnérable. La part belle de notre programmation porte sur les "sub-cultures" et les nouveaux mouvements culturels urbains qu’il prennent naissance en Europe ou dans d’autres régions du monde.\n\nRecyclart s’intègre dans une dynamique d’économie sociale. L’association répond en cela au discours dominant  du « renouveau des industries culturelles » et de l’importance de la « ville créative » par une vision plus locale et plus solidaire. Recyclart engage en effet dans le cadre d’un programme de transition professionnelle une quinzaine de personnes, composant notamment ses équipes de menuisiers, métallos, gestion d’infrastructure, ou de cuisine, mais aussi son centre d’art. Dans ce cadre, Recyclart défend une vision liée à la remise à l’emploi, plutôt que l’employabilité. Il s’agit en effet de créer les opportunités nécessaires à chacun de réaliser ses propres objectifs professionnels plutôt que de les « formater » à un marché de l’emploi de plus en plus individualiste.\n\nRecyclart est composé d’un centre d’art, d’un Bar resto et de Fabrik, un centre de production artisanal. L’équipe est composée de +/- 35 personnes.

Working in fields like sound, video, design, painting, multimedia, robotics, interactive technology and media production, we allow the integration of our distinctive areas of research and practice to define a unique style in the realization of various projects - from multimedia theatrical plays to experimental audio-visual shows and from electroacoustic compositions to human-machine-computer interfaces. Medea organizes annually Koumaria Residency. Currently she is working on the ongoing site specific project SoundscapesLandscapes.

1085	586	organisation_mission	<p style="text-align: left;">framework began broadcasting in june, 2002, and now broad- and podcasts online and on radio stations around the world.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">framework is consecrated to field recording and it's use in composition, and began at a time when a new community of sound artists with a special interest in found sound was developing, a community spread across the world and no longer, thanks to the internet, limited to a specific geography.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">framework sees itself as an outlet for this ever-growing and developing community, a folk-tool in a new folk movement, a community driven exchange point for creators and listeners alike.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">framework's goal is to present not only the extremely diverse sound environments of our world, but also the extremely diverse work that is being produced by the artists who choose to use these environments as their sonic materials.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">we hope to ask this question: is 'field-recording' a style, or a genre, or is it in fact as uncontrollable and undefinable an instrument or tool as any, that may be interpreted, manipulated and appropriated by anyone with a microphone and an idea? These works are its definition, and not vice versa.</p>

1097	634	organisation_mission	The art and culture initiative “qujOchÖ – experimentelle Kunst- und Kulturarbeit” was founded in Linz in 2001. qujOchÖ intervenes in processes at the intersections of art, politics, society and science using methods ranging from artistic interventions in public space, series of public lectures and discussions, sound and visual forms of action, to participatory installations. The approach and modus operandi of qujOchÖ is regularly characterised by a transdisciplinarity of science and art, a distinctive intensity, and a critical examination of customary cultural practices.
